# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use on Linux (and macOS).

## How to use

Clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles` and run `install` script which creates symbolic links using [gnu-stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mil-ad/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install
```
